Q: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

Q: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
A: Hoisting in JavaScript is the process by which variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope. This allows them to be used before they are declared.

Q: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression in JavaScript?
A: A function declaration in JavaScript is a statement that creates a function and gives it a name. A function expression in JavaScript is an expression that creates a function and assigns it to a variable. The main difference between the two is that function declarations are hoisted, while function expressions are not.
